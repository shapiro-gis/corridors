                <p> These data represent the DWR edited version of statistically based polygons derived from GPS collared data on animals migrating in Utah from 2016 - 2021. The GPS data were analyzed using the Brownian Bridge Movement Model (BBMM), which produced polygons based on an animal’s movement path from data recorded at brief intervals. This model understands that location points are connected to each other in time. Every animal has its own footprint of its migration. Each animal’s averaged footprint is combined into one layer. Corridor level of use types are combined and clipped into one dataset and the level of use is classified:
                   <br></br>

                <br>High Use: > 75% of the population </br>
                    
                <br>Medium use: 25 - 75% of the population </br>
                    
                <br> Low use: 0 - 25% of the population </br>
